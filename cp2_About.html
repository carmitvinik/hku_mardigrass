                            Mardi Gras in New Orleans [About]
                        </h2>
                        <p class="row m-3">The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the
                            city
                            of New
                            Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove
                            Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian
                            tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days have
                            several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days
                            of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and
                            surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).

                        <p class="row m-3">The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes;
                            most follow the
                            same parade schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick
                            Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several
                            modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events, such as the Krewe
                            of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand marshals for their
                            parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as
                            well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float
                            riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of
                            colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small
                            inexpensive toys, but throws can also include lingerie and more sordid items. Major krewes
                            follow the same parade schedule and route each year. </p>
